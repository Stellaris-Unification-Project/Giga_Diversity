#All unique worlds have 100% chance of spawning. Like with exotic planets check after spawn and set the global flag.
#At least one PD Shrouded World is spawned at galaxy start, and up to 4 depending on the galaxy size. Check is preformed like the other checks
#There is always an abandonded EcoArc in the galaxy according the spawn chance it is 100%. Check is done like the other checks above
